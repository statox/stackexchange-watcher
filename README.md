# StackExchange-watcher
Watch new questions on stackexchange sites and get a slack notification for new questions

# Why?
Because if you are like me, you like to contribute to StackExchanges sites which
don't have a lot of traffic. And you don't want to check the new question page
every ten minutes.

So you can simply run this code on your local machine or in a cloud function and
get a nice Slack notification with the link to the questions you didn't already
see.

# How?

## Configuration

The file `config.json` contains all the keys you need to run the application:

 - `slack.webhookurl` *Always keep it private* The URL generated by slack to
   reach your team. See their doc
   [here](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks)
 - `slack.channel` The channel which should get the notification of the new
   question. You can specify either a `#channel` or a `@user`
 - `slack.username` The screenname of the bot when it sends you a notification
 - `persitence.idfilepath` The path to the file where the application will write
   the ID of the last seen question
 - `stackexchange.sites` A JSON array of the sites you want to follow
 - `stackexchange.refresh` The refresh rate of the app in seconds

## Running the app

First clone this repo, then use `npm` to install the dependencies:

    npm install

You're ready to go, simply start the app with:

    npm start

# What's under the hood?

 - [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) for the web request
 - [cheerio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio) for the HTML parsing
 - [node-slack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-slack) for the notification to slack

# Roadmap

 - [ ] Watch the review queues
 - [ ] Support several slack users to have one instance for several users in the
   same slack team
 - [ ] Get rid of the id file to prepare the deployment as cloud function
 - [ ] Make deployable in cloud function out of the box
